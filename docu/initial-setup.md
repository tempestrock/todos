## Prerequisites

You should have (or be willing to get) a basic understanding of

- AWS accounts and users
- Docker
- Typescript, Nodejs, React, Vite, and pnpm

Also, `bash` is used to run a few scripts. So we are talking Linux here. ðŸ˜‰  
If you are on a Mac, you're already fine.  
For Windows users, I recommend using
[WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install),
e.g. with an Ubuntu 24.04 image. You get it in the Microsoft Store. Altenatively,
you can use the AWS CLI in PowerShell. But then the bash scripts
won't work. A middle ground could be using [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/).

## Getting the Local Dev Env Up and Running

For the local development environment, we basically need an AWS account
where we create a user pool (AWS Cognito) and a few database tables
(AWS DynamoDB).

### AWS Account

If you don't already have one,
[create an AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/onboarding-to-aws/).

Once that's done, the next step is to get the necessary credentials onto your
local development machine. You can do this either by creating a dedicated user
with the appropriate permissions or by using the
[AWS access portal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/signin/latest/userguide/iam-id-center-sign-in-tutorial.html)
to copy the credentials of your user directly into your terminal.

In either case, you should end up with the environment variables `AWS_REGION`,
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` set on your system. If your
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` starts with `ASIA`, you're using session-based authentication,
which also requires setting the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`.

AWS is a vast platform, so feel free to dive into the details with the extensive
documentation available online.

### Clone This Repo

On your local machine, call

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tempestrock/todos.git
cd todos
```

to get the source code onto your machine.

### User Pool

Create a user pool in AWS Cognito. You can do this either manually (not
recommended) or by using the script I prepared.

Run

```bash
./scripts/create-user-pool.sh <user-pool-name>
```

where `<user-pool-name>` is the name you want to give your user pool. Something
along the lines of `todos` will do for example.

Again, the AWS credentials must be set as environment variables in order for the
script (or to be precise: for the AWS CLI commands in it) to have access
to your AWS account.

The script also creates an initial user `alex` with a temporary password
`N0tVeryS4fePW!`. You can use this user to test the app. The password will
need to be changed during the first login, and the app is able to handle that.

### Database

Create the necessary DynamoDB tables. You can do this by running
[the script I prepared](../scripts/create-db-tables.sh):

```bash
./scripts/create-db-tables.sh --env-name dev
```

As stated in the [architecture docu](./architecure.md), I distinguish between
`dev`, `uat`, and `prod`. And this call creates the tables for the `dev`
environment.

### Starting the App

Now that the basic installations are done, you can start the app.

For that, you need `pnpm` installed on your local machine. If you don't have
it, yet, you can install it with `npm install -g pnpm`. However, I recommend
installing [volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) first and then
using `volta install pnpm` instead.

Once `pnpm` is installed, run

```bash
pnpm dev
```

in the terminal that has the AWS credentials set as environment variables.

You can now open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173. If everything
works, you should see the app running which forwards you to the login page.

Congrats! The first mile stone is done! ðŸŽ‰

## Production Machine

In my case, the production machine is an on-premises machine which
hosts the app for the UAT as well as the prod environment.

```bash
docker network create todos_network
```
